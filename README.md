        The Geolocation API allows the user to provide their location to web applications if they so desire.
        For privacy reasons, the user is asked for permission to report location information.

        WebExtensions that wish to use the Geolocation object must add the "geolocation" permission to their manifest.
        The user's operating system will prompt the user to allow location access the first time it is requested.
                
                
 The Geolocation API is accessed
 
        navigator.geolocation
        
The developer can now access this location information in a couple of different ways:

         Geolocation.getCurrentPosition(): Retrieves the device's current location.
